Broodstock management is a crucial component of any fish hatchery operation. This study
evaluated the University of Miami Experimental Hatchery (UMEH)’s adherence to its Cobia
(Rachycentron canadum) broodstock standard operating procedure (SOP), as well as evaluate
broodstock performance. This was done by performing a spatial analysis in R Studio (build
4.1.1) using daily water temperature, holding tank, and spawn data from January 2018 to June
2022 for two genetically distinct cohorts of cobia broodstock maintained at the UMEH (Group 1
& Group 2). Statistical tests were performed to compare water temperatures in holding tanks
across groups, holding tanks within groups, and to determine if a statistically significant
correlation exists between water temperature and spawning frequency. Our findings show that
water temperature in holding tanks is not significantly different across groups, though water
temperature across several holding tanks within a group were found to be significantly different.
Our findings also show that a significant correlation exists between water temperature and
spawning frequency in Group 1, while a significant correlation does not exist between water
temperature and spawning frequency in Group 2. This analysis shows that further research is
needed to develop a better understanding of the dynamics between water quality parameters and
spawning frequency to develop regressional models that can predict future spawning events.
